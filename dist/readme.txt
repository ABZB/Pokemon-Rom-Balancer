Instuctions:

1) Decompress & Extract Ultra Sun or Ultra Moon

2) Open the folder "ExtractedRomFS/a/0/1/"

3) Open the file 7

4) Go to the address 4CF0 (it will be the start of the line)

5) Select everything from there to the end of the file

6) Copy the selected text into a text file, name it "text.txt", and place it in the same folder as 600 Balancer

7) Run 600 Balancer.exe

8) Open output_text.txt

9) Select All, then copy

10) In your Hex Editor, select all the text from 4CF0 to the end of the file

11) paste

12) Save and exit the hex editor

13) Either recompile or grab the a/0/1/7 if you're using Luma

Note: The whole thing with copying to the text editor happened because I had initially done so to use notepad++ to find various data, and check what I was editing, and along the way I forgot to write the script to edit the hex file directly. I'll probably get around to doing that.
